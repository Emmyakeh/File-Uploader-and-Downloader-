# Overview
I developed a JavaScript program to demonstrate sorting algorithms and compare their performance on large datasets. This project serves as an exploration of JavaScript's capabilities, focusing on implementing fundamental sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, while also incorporating error handling to ensure effectiveness.

The software consists of JavaScript classes for Bubble Sort and Quick Sort algorithms, along with a testing utility to generate random arrays, sort them using the algorithms, and measure their execution times. Exception handling is implemented to manage errors related to input validation and sorting correctness.

# Development Environment

- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Language: JavaScript
- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code

# Useful Websites

- [JavaScript Documentation](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array)
- [GeeksforGeeks - Sorting Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)


# Future Work

- Implement additional sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Selection Sort for comparison.
- Enhance the exception handling to cover more edge cases and improve error messaging.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the sorting process and results.
